Hello

Introduction:
-

I did this test base on Symfony 4 framework(my favourite) and doctrine ORM(for writing, I do not implement read part, If I would, I prefer MemcacheD), It set free times of employer and candidate in 24 hours format.
How To Start:
-
There would be easier than just running a single command: `./build.sh` in root of project. That's all, there you are.
